üöÄ AI MEME STOCK PREDICTOR - PROJECT OVERVIEW SUMMARY
================================================================================

üìã PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
The AI Meme Stock Predictor is a revolutionary application that bridges the gap 
between traditional financial analysis and modern social media-driven market 
sentiment. It's designed to analyze "meme stocks" - stocks that gain popularity 
through social media platforms and online communities.

üéØ WHAT IT DOES:
================================================================================
‚Ä¢ Analyzes stock sentiment from Reddit (WallStreetBets) and Twitter/X
‚Ä¢ Processes real-time market data (prices, volume, historical trends)
‚Ä¢ Combines social sentiment with financial indicators
‚Ä¢ Uses AI (Google Gemini + Portia) for advanced analysis and predictions
‚Ä¢ Provides humorous, engaging responses with meme references
‚Ä¢ Offers multiple interfaces: Telegram bot, CLI, and REST API

üß† HOW IT WORKS:
================================================================================
1. USER INPUT: User asks about a stock (e.g., "TSLA memes?")
2. DATA COLLECTION: System fetches data from multiple sources in parallel
3. ANALYSIS: AI processes sentiment, meme intensity, and market signals  
4. PREDICTION: Combines weighted features to generate bullish/bearish/neutral prediction
5. RESPONSE: Returns detailed analysis with humor and personality

üîß KEY TECHNOLOGIES:
================================================================================
‚Ä¢ Python 3.11+ with FastAPI web framework
