🚀 AI MEME STOCK PREDICTOR - COMPREHENSIVE WORKING PRINCIPLE
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
================================================================================
The AI Meme Stock Predictor is an advanced artificial intelligence system that 
analyzes stock market trends through the lens of social media sentiment and 
"meme culture" to predict potential stock movements. It combines traditional 
financial data with modern social sentiment analysis to provide unique insights 
into stocks that gain popularity through social media platforms.

CORE CONCEPT:
================================================================================
Traditional stock analysis relies heavily on financial metrics, technical 
indicators, and fundamental analysis. However, in the modern digital age, 
social media sentiment and viral trends significantly impact stock prices, 
especially for "meme stocks" like GameStop (GME), Tesla (TSLA), and AMC.

This project bridges that gap by:
1. Monitoring social media discussions about stocks
2. Quantifying "meme intensity" and viral potential
3. Analyzing sentiment patterns across platforms
4. Combining social signals with market data
5. Generating predictions with humor and personality
